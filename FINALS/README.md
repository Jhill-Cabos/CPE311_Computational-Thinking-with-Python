<h1 align="center">ðŸ’¬ CONCLUSION: CPE311_Computational-Thinking-with-Python</h1>
In my finals, I was able to further enhance my understanding of data and successfully create a comprehensive project that integrated multiple concepts from the course, especially in the context of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region using SAP. This project not only solidified my grasp of Python programming but also honed my problem-solving abilities with a focus on regional data applications. The skills I developed in this course, such as efficient algorithm design, data manipulation, and debugging, will be invaluable in my future academic and professional pursuits. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through CPE311: Computational Thinking with Python, and I look forward to applying these concepts in real-world scenarios, particularly in addressing data challenges and opportunities within the ASEAN region using SAP technologies.
